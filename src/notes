babel-core is used for running babel in our app from webpack (very similar to babel-cli)
babel-loader (teach webpack how to run babel)
test: /\.js$/ This means that babel will be run only through files that have .js ending. that is a regular expression

babelrc will allow us to use the presets that we used before (env, react). We need this so that we can use the special syntax. Later we will
do this with CSS
